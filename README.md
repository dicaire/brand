This repository is used to centralise assets files for my [open source projects](https://github.com/BHDicaire).

Your visual assets should be unique. These are mine. Fork this repository to _learn_ about my process, please make your own assets.

## Getting started
The following file types are used:
* **.clr**: macOS color palettes
* **.afdesign**: [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)

The [Sukima Stencil typeface](https://creativemarket.com/DesignByPlatform/2575932-Sukima-Stencil-%E2%80%93-A-Display-Font) is designed by [Ryan Miglinczy](https://designbyplatform.co.uk).
